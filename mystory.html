            <h2>My Path</h2>
            <p>As a designer and storyteller, my work is shaped by my Korean heritage and the profound idea of inyeon (인연)—the fateful ties that connect us. These connections foster resilience and community. Through my art and creativity, I aim to share a vision of a united humanity. I hope to inspire others to embrace creativity empowered by inner wisdom, so we can all grow and rise together.</p>

            <h5>Roots and Wisdom</h5>
            <p>Moved by the concept of inhwa (인화)—harmony and unity—I am guided by solidarity for the continuation of humanity. I earned my B.S. in Integrated Design and Media, with a minor in Media, Culture, and Communication, from NYU’s Tandon School of Engineering. My early education in liberal arts provided me with a global perspective on culture, society, and philosophy. Living in Florence taught me how global systems shape our lives, while the vibrant community of New York City reinforced my commitment to inclusive design. By examining how global power structures and suffering are affected by media technologies, I am reimagining the role of digital technologies to truly empower human agency.</p>

            <h5>Blending STEAM Disciplines</h5>
            <p>My work combines STEAM disciplines—art, science, and technology—to create human-centered designs. At NYU’s IDM program, I focused on digital media technology, drawing from psychology, sociology, and anthropology to build experiences that connect people. The program’s project-based approach, blending theory with practical skills, guides my process. Through collaborative projects like "Ouroboros," which harmonizes technology and human connection, I explore the communal bonds of inyeon.</p>

            <h5>Crafting Connection</h5>
            <p>My senior thesis, "Ouroboros," invited over 200 visitors into a serene space with soft spatial audio and gentle projections, weaving insights from psychophysiology and sociology to enable collective healing. In "Metamorphoses," my sound designs merged with projection art and choreography, embodying cycles of transformation. At Cafe DVD, I manage projects fostering media democracy and cultural preservation, now initiating branding and social media outreach for cultural movement. At Harvestworks, I orchestrated art-tech events, incubating hybrid third spaces for innovation and attentive listening. Embracing Anaïs Nin's belief that “each friend represents a world in us," my work continues to spark connective creativity by rupturing silence with truth.            </p>

            <h5>Vision for Impact</h5>
            <p>I dream of designs that bring people together, using technology to foster connection and growth. My goal is to create experiences where technology acts as a gentle thread, tying us closer through empathetic storytelling deciphering what it means to be human. </p>

            <h5>
                A Journey of Learning:
            </h5>
            <p>As a lifelong learner, I am delving into user experience, data, and AI, grounding my work in ethical, sustainable choices. By exploring virtual and augmented reality, I aim to reshape learning into an embodied experience, crafting a future where design listens to the unity and diversity of humanity.</p>

            <h2>What Shapes Me</h2>
            <p>My Korean heritage, family, education, and artistry have woven the fabric of who I am. From the resilience and community spirit of my cultural roots to the creative exploration of music and design, these moments and roles define my approach to storytelling and human-centered design.</p>
