                <h5>Research and Methods Statement: Functional Tree Sculpture</h5>
                <h5>Introduction</h5>
                <p>This project presents a hand-carved, clay sculpture designed as a functional jewelry holder, inspired by the organic and philosophical architectural principles of Antoni Gaudí. The sculpture, with its croqueseque, skeletal tree-like form and bone-white finish, serves as both an aesthetic elevation of space and a critique of human material culture. It evokes a sense of nature’s beauty and degradation, using jewelry as a symbol of consumptive habits to highlight the grotesque undercurrents of societal materialism.</p>
                <h5>Research: Gaudí’s Influence</h5>
                <p>Antoni Gaudí’s architectural legacy, as explored in <i>Gaudí His Life, His Theories, His Work</i> (Martinell, 1975), <i>Gaudí the Complete Works</i> (Zerbst, 2020), and the official websites for Casa Batlló and La Pedrera, profoundly shapes this sculpture’s conceptual and aesthetic framework. Gaudí’s childhood immersion in nature, due to his health conditions, fostered a deep connection to organic forms, evident in the fluid, biomorphic structures of Casa Batlló (<i>Antoni Gaudí Biography | Casa Batlló</i>). His philosophy, as Martinell notes, integrated art, engineering, and functionality, creating spaces that were both utilitarian and culturally significant. For instance, La Pedrera’s multifaceted use—residential, commercial, and cultural—demonstrates Gaudí’s commitment to holistic design (<i>Gaudí, the Work</i>). Zerbst emphasizes Gaudí’s attention to aesthetic and functional considerations, balancing context, significance, and visual impact in works like La Sagrada Familia. This sculpture mirrors Gaudí’s ability to evoke emotional and philosophical responses, repurposed here to critique the environmental and cultural toll of human consumption.</p>
                <h5>Methods: Construction Process</h5>
                <p>The sculpture was hand-crafted from clay, chosen for its malleability and organic texture, which aligns with Gaudí’s tactile, nature-inspired processes. The construction involved the following steps:</p>
                <p>1. <b>Form Development</b>: The tree-like structure was sketched to resemble gnarled, skeletal branches, evoking both natural growth and decay. This croqueseque form was inspired by Gaudí’s organic, flowing designs, reimagined with a darker, skeletal aesthetic.</p>
                <p>2. <b>Hand-Carving</b>: The clay was molded and carved by hand to create intricate, uneven surfaces that mimic bone texture. This labor-intensive process ensured a unique, artisanal quality, reflecting Gaudí’s emphasis on craftsmanship.</p>
                <p>3. <b>Finishing</b>: A white glaze, reminiscent of bleached bones or ancient artifacts, was applied to enhance the grotesque yet elegant aesthetic. The finish underscores the sculpture’s commentary on decay and preservation.</p>
                <p>4. <b>Functional Integration</b>: Branches were shaped to hold jewelry, ensuring the piece serves as a practical holder while maintaining its artistic integrity. This mirrors Gaudí’s seamless integration of form and function in his architectural works.</p>
                <h5>Conclusion</h5>
                <p>This functional tree sculpture, inspired by Gaudí’s nature-centric philosophy and holistic design principles, merges aesthetic innovation with social commentary. Its hand-carved, bone-white form and croqueseque structure evoke the beauty and degradation of nature, while its role as a jewelry holder critiques the perverse materialism of human culture. By blending functionality, artistry, and critique, the sculpture honors Gaudí’s legacy while offering a contemporary reflection on consumption and environmental loss.</p>
