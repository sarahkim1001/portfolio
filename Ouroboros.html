                <p>Ouroboros is an immersive installation inviting participants to pause, reflect, and face the complexities of memory, dreams, and mediated realities. As participants crawl into a play tunnel lined with artificial grass and bubble wrap, they enter a private burrow separated from the surrounding physical space through sound, projection, and architecture.</p>
                <p>Given bluetooth headphones, participants are enveloped in a shifting soundscape that transcends the immediate environment. This auditory design, featuring a blend of weather sounds, urban textures, digital glitches, noises and echos anchored by distortions of Claude Debussy’s Clair de Lune, acts as a gateway to introspection. Sound shapes consciousness, altering states of mind and positioning participants in a space of saturated awareness, challenging them to navigate their internal landscapes amidst external stimuli. Inspired by Pauline Oliveros’ sonic meditations, the audio design confronts participants: what thoughts arise and pass? Where is one's place within their psyche?</p>
                <p>Encircling the entire tunnel, drifting cloud projections evoke nostalgia for a simpler past, perhaps childhood, inspiring participants to reconnect with moments of innocence and wonder. This comforting yet confining tactile environment—a passage that feels infinite yet limited—awakens the inner child, providing solace amidst the work-driven stress and anxiety that fray modern psyches.</p>
                <p>Ouroboros is a memory palace where dreams confront an uncertain reality. It challenges the passivity of digital consumption, where identities are molded by capitalist agendas. It questions: What is real? Who controls one's calm? The installation invites participants to navigate a mediated world, reflecting on how escapism demonstrated by headphone culture can be transformed into thoughtful introspection to empower individuals.</p>
                <p>As participants linger in Ouroboros, they are empowered to resurface suppressed noise, nostalgia, and forgotten dreams. It encourages self-discovery amidst unpredictability, finding the constant sky beyond passing chaos, and reclaiming inner peace in a world where reality and representation blur. By offering a space to pause, play, and find stillness, Ouroboros challenges the very essence of control and authenticity, restoring the power of introspection to the people.</p>
